3. Railway creates the database automatically

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (1 min)

1. Click on your web service in Railway
2. Go to "Variables" tab
3. Railway should auto-detect DATABASE_URL from PostgreSQL
4. Add these additional variables:

```
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret-here

```

To generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET, run:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Step 4: Set Up File Storage (1 min)

### Option A: Uploadthing (Easiest)
